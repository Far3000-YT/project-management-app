    git clone https://github.com/Far3000-YT/project-management-app.git
    cd project-management-app
    ```

3.  **Build the Application:**
    Use Maven to build the project and download dependencies.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once the API is running and the project is built, you can start the JavaFX application using Maven:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

This will launch the application window.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage
